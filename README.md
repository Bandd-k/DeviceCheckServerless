# DeviceCheckServerless

Apple allows to set and query of two binary digits of data per device, which are persistent even after uninstallation. For example, you might use this data to identify devices that have already taken advantage of a promotional offer that you provide or to flag a device that youâ€™ve determined to be fraudulent.
DeviceCheck API is designed to be used with a server, but this small package allows you to do everything on the device. Note that an on-device solution is more vulnerable to hackers attacks

## Installation

### With Swift Package Manager
```ruby

```

## How to Use

```swift
let keyID = "GG8TWG834Q"
let teamID = "SE9N6X5V7C"
let p8 = """
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

"""
// init DeviceCheck with your own p8, keyID and teamID
// https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list generate key for DeviceCheck here
// https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership/ find teamID here

let deviceCheck = DeviceCheck(p8: p8, keyId: keyID, teamId: teamID, developmentAPI: true)
let bits = try await deviceCheck.query()
print(bits)
try await deviceCheck.update(DeviceCheck.Bits(bit0: true, bit1: true))
```
